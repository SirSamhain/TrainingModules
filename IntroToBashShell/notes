Why bash? 
	Bash is a command line shell
		* gives you access to many UNIX utilites
		* efficiently run complex tasks
		* and make them repeatable 
	some use cases
		* file management
		* Processing data
		* System administrator
		* remote access
		* scripting
	Dominant shell on UNIX

UNIX Philosophy	
	Write programs that do one thing and do it well
	Write programs that work together
	Write programs to handle text streams
		* because that is a universal interface
pwd path to working directory

echo $BASH

mv rm cp have the -i switch which basically just asks if you want to actually delete the stuff lol
